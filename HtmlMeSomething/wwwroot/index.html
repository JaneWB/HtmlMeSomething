<h1>My Bucket List</h1>
    <h5>By: Jane Brown</h5>
    <h3>I am a person who loves to travel! But being one of 12 children (which gives me 11 siblings) 
    and having 4 children of my own, leaves time a lost commodity.  Take it from me, 
    the more family you have, the busier you are.  Which of course is a blessing but doesn't allow for a lot
    of free time!  Now, add a career to the mix and POOF, limited to no time left.  On the other hand, as you 
    all know, traveling is not cheap.  So, the career is necessary.  Oh, the old adage, "so much to do, with
    such little time".</h3>
    <h2>So, I created a bucket list:</h2>

    <ul>
    <li>Alaska</li>
    <li>Maine</li>
    <li>Africa</li>
    <li>Australia</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sure, it's small but doable.  In fact, I've been knocking it out!!!  
    So, where have I been?  What has been eliminated from the list?</h3>
    <h2>Alaska</h2>
    <h3>Alaska is unique and quaint.  Quaint in the sense that people and neighbors are appreciated.
    Odd for a state that is sooo large.  I went crabbing and ate the crab afterwards, mmm mmm.  Walked 
    on a glacier!  Came back and went to a salmon bake.  Lovely people and lovely place.  Alaska feels 
    like a place where living off the land is natural.</h3>

    <h2>Maine</h2>
    <h3>Maine is beautiful and I loved it!  I went sailing, not only as a passenger,
    but as a deck hand!  Light houses are everywhere in Maine and exploring them 
    was fascinating.  I ate lobster in every way possible.  I love lobster and was on 
    a mission to eat it for every meal.  In the process, I learned my husband hates lobster.  
    Oh well, more for me.</h3>

    <h2>Australia</h2>
    <h3>I haven't been to Australia but it has been kicked off my list.</h3>

    <h3>Too many things can kill you there!</h3>

    <h2>Africa</h2>
    <h3>Africa is the place that is still on my list.  Sure, it sounds dangerous,
    but I would love to go on a safari.  I have saved this for last for two reasons,
    first, it is going to be expensive and second, I have to talk my husband into it.  Stay tuned, 
    pictures to come. . . </h3>

    <h3>Does anyone seem a theme here - food seems to be very significant.  Maybe I should add the Miami Food 
    Festival to my Bucket List!!!!!!</h3>

    <h3>The Bucket List, ever changing.  Life, as they say, is too short.  And of course, there is
    the money thing!</h3>

    <h3>Words of advice while traveling, don't do your own stunts!</h3>
